# 1. Analyze various coding annotations

## Use manuscript data/MSSNG/Simons_519, scaling factors are computed using WGS data, based on coding regions and regions 10kb within TSSs.
Annotations include 
+ Ribosnitch (allele-specific)
+ RBP binding sites
+ conservation
+ Polyphen-damaging (Mis3)
+ Loss-of-function and Gain-of-function
+ CADD 

> Other scaling options include using non-functional synonymous mutations.
