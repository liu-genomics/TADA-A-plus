# Welcome to TADA-A-plus
## Introduction
TADA-A-plus is a extended version of the original TADA-A, which was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics. There are a few significant improvements that are hopefully of general interst to the community studying de novo mutations. These improvements include a mixture binoimal model-based computational framework to estimate the realtive risk of annotations, a efficient pipeline to simulate DNMs given a sample size, a set of base-level mutation rate files and annotations with certain relative risk.
